# CppToys
A bunch of C++ stuff that I made when I just started learning about programming.

## CountSheep
A "screensaver" for the command line. Compile and run and watch the cookie count grow!

## FirstProject
Playground from when I was trying to wrap my head around object-oriented concepts; don't run this.

## int_search
I accidentally reinvented pigeonhole sort one night. I was wondering why anyone would use anything like bubble sort and insertion sort that was so unintuitive, and tried to come up with my own way of sorting that was closer to how a human would roughly do it, being able to tell from the number itself roughly how high up the list it would go.
